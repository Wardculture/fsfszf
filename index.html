<h1>A Push Of The Button</h1>
<h2>Violent video games and their effects on violent behaviour</h2>
<span>Piece by <a href="https://twitter.com/travisward95">Travis Ward</a></span>

</section>

<section class="start content">

  <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
  <p>Video games have been a focus of mine for many years and over the last two decades have slowly crept up into the mainstream, practically on par with movies and music. With anything that's popular comes criticism and video games are renowned by many groups as violent. The important questions are: what does violence insinuate i.e. are there different definitions of violent behaviour? Do these games actually influence violence, or, are there other concepts to gaming that cause aggression/violence? </p>

  <p>I have been playing video games for many years and I have played a whole variety of genres from RPG to Party to Beat em up’s. Do I think of myself as a violent person? I do not. Do I find myself to be an aggressive person? I don’t believe so. On the other hand, when I play video games, definitely ones which frustrate me, I do raise my voice, use expletives and gain anger due to frustration from lag, continuously dying or the game not working. </p>

<p>I don’t feel personally that I am being too violent. I feel it is a matter of frustration, passion and the desire to play the game seeing as once I stop playing the game I am no longer like this. It is for sure a sign that there is a link between video games and aggression there is no doubt of this, but human beings do become aggressive for a number of reasons, let alone video games. </p>

<h3>How did such accusations come about?</h3>
<p>Video games have been around since the late 1960's and took rise in the 70s with Pong and Atari. The idea of violence crept up around the late 90s where first person shooters became a primary source of gameplay such as id Software's alien classic Doom. This increased further with titles like Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and Tom Clancy games in the 21st century. Games have always had some prospect of violence it would seem like Pacman eating ghosts, shooting aliens in Space Invaders and even Mario and Sonic jump on their enemies who vanish. It takes into perspective that 'violence' seems to be defined by the realism of video games and their graphics. </p>
<p>In the media there has been a link between violent video games and school shootings such as the the two teenagers who carried out the Columbine Massacre where one of the gunmen had supposedly named their gun after one from Doom. In recent years other shootings including: Aurora, CO, theater shooting (2012), Sandy Hook (2012) and the Washington Navy massacre (2013) have been the target of video game involvement. The media feel gaming habits of the gunmen could have been the reason these crimes took place or that it was a method of training.</p>

<figcaption>18 is a general rating for video games but 18 games are so diverse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Age ratings on video games are an issue because the maximum rating a video game has in the UK is 18. A large amount of video games have this but do not all feature the same type of content which creates the issue of how bad is this game in comparison to others. Grand Theft Auto and Manhunt are both violent games there’s no doubt about it, but when comparing both games, their levels of violence are so drastically different. This highlights the problem with age ratings for young viewers due to Manhunt being one of the most violent and gory video games ever…it even got banned. </p>
<p>Examples of 18-rated content include sex, drugs, violence, racism, swearing, gore and more. Children witness a lot of this content in movies which people seem to be okay with. Some films which feature sex, drugs, violence, death and horrifying gore can be listed as 12 or 15 in Britain like in a Batman or James Bond movie. What is important to think about with ratings is who is buying these games and who is playing them. The millennial and 90’s generation are fine with video games and consider them mainstream. The older generation are slowly catching up but parents who accuse video games of being violent can come under scrutiny of not experiencing the game themselves. It is important for parents to reflect on their child's behaviour by being involved in their activities. If they feel no alteration in their behaviour then they should question whether the game is really affecting their child. If children experience so much nevativity in the real world, is a story that isn't true really going to affect them?
  </p>
  <p>
    Games like The Last of Us have received an 18 rating but comparing it to a title like GTA V separates them massively. Yes The Last of Us has violence but it has important moral decisions to be made and requires a lot of thinking and emotions from the player, whereas GTA V doesn't give that affect. It means that some games don't deserve these ratings and sometimes rely on parents and their belief. The less invested a parent is then the longer this problem will continue.

<h2>My interview with Middlesex University psychologist Mark Coulson</h2>

</div>

<p>
I interviewed Mark Coulson because of his research into video games and violence. His studies have found that in the short-term there can be an aggression but ultimately they have yet to find a link between violence being caused through video games. </p>
  <p>Violent games can be argued to be a safe environment for people because yes, we've had violence for thousands of years but when you think about video games it is merely just fantasies and it is better for such actions to be carried out in this sense.</p>

<p>
  One of the main problems that arise from scientific research into video games, especially the APA Review is that in this review there was no new research conducted and the report looked at a decade of other findings. Another issue that follows is that results on whether video games cause violence are usually inconclusive and so more research is required. It feels as though there will never be an answer but the idea will always be there. </p>
  <p>The APA review stated that children younger than age 8 who play video games spend a daily average of 69 minutes on hand-held console games, 57 minutes on computer games, and 45 minutes on mobile games, including tablets. Considering the vast number of children and youth who use video games and that more than 85% of video games on the market contain some form of violence, it could create some worries that young children are being immersed too much in violent video games. </p>

  <h2>A survey on violent games
</h2>

<figure>
<div> <img src="img/IMG_04.jpeg" alt="" />
<figcaption>My results from my survey of 35 people</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  I conducted a survey with 35 people. There were six people aged 18, 27 people aged between 19-25 and two people aged between 26 and 35. 23 were male, 12 were female. They were asked questions on video game violence and to give their opinions where it was requested. My results found that a lot of them, over 60% of them played first person shooters. Other popular games included Adventure, Action and Role Playing Games. The majority spend up to fifteen hours in an average week on video games, but a good percentage (34%) play between 15 and 40 hours. Over 50% play on Xbox, Playstation and PC which have a large catalogue of violent games. The results thus far show that a lot of these people play first person shooters with plenty of exposure during the week to these games on modern platforms.

</p>

<blockquote class="left">
   "Actually commiting a senseless violent act after playing a game I think is down to the characteristics of the individual player than the games themselves"
</blockquote>
<p>
The majority (35.29%) of those who answered how often they purchase video games said monthly. This gives the impression that there are plenty of people who are continuously getting an access to new video games and that there are people are consistently up to date on video games.

</p>
<p> When asked why they were aggressive. I was told that popular games League of Legends and Dota 2 have a toxic environment and people get so mad they either refuse to communicate or play with certain people. </p>
<blockquote class="right">
   "Video games are given a rating for a reason, but if the person who is playing them is responsible enough not to be influenced in any way by the graphic scenes, then by all means parents should feel free to purchase a video game for them even if they are under aged. "
</blockquote>
<p> That ruins the social aspect of video games when there are those who ruin it for others and adds to the fact that with our vast social gaming experience in the modern day, other players can be a factor for aggression and not the video game itself. </P>
<p>When asked if they thought video games caused violent behaviour I got a mixture of replies saying video games were a means to vent and others stated they brought out the worst in people. One person believed that parents do not pay much close attention to age ratings due to it being in a heavily fluctuated market and don't really know what they're buying their child. </p>
<p> When comparing Mario and GTA, many found there were no similarities and that the realism of GTA plays an impact. One of the interesting things that was mentioned was that a 'death' in Mario is not really addressed as such or addressed at all. Compare that to GTA, the graphical evidence speaks more than words.

<h2>What studies have found</h2>


  <p>
    A 2004 study looked at the comparison between people playing a violent video game and those who played a simple non-violent game. The shooter, Bungie’s Marathon 2, showed signs of aggression in comparison to the users playing a simple game of Glider Pro. What then heightened the players to be of a hostile nature were the mechanisms of the game which could reflect how people behave in other games. Both titles are PC games. Glider Pro uses two keys whereas Marathon 2 used 20. The complexity of the game gives the idea that players will become frustrated due to the remembering and skill that is required.
  </p>

<p>
  This is true for many PC titles due to the range of keyboard options, each key can stand for something and the lack of competence a player feels in the game could lead to anger. This idea reflects Przybylski’s Tetris study where the controls were altered and the least likeliest game to cause people to be aggresive, Tetris, enraged those who under time pressure had to remember that triangle was move left and the left bumper was to move right. After this they increased the game difficulty where a 1x4 thin block would be required on the bottom row but the player would be given a 2x2 square block. It gives the idea that it isn’t just violent nature/thoughts that could be influenced through violent imagery, but merely the concept of how the game works is enough to enrage someone.
</p>

<figcaption>The configuration of the Tetris controller</figcaption>
</figure>

<p> Przybylski's research also highlights how long-term and short term involvement with video games can cause how aggressive a person can become. Short-term playing highlights that the frustration that builds up could remain unlike long-term playing where a player will most likely improve their gameplaying abilities. This would supposedly subside any built up aggression over time. Feeling the need to be better at video games or being bad at them is another factor into the build up of the person. Przybylski's fundamentals highlight how we need to feel competent at something. I know this personally because when being bad at a video game, it can really build up rage because you feel so passionate and want to play through these games. I had one experience with A Link To The Past, a game which involves killing enemies with multiple weapons, but, is from a cartoon style top down perspective. When trying to defeat the Tower of Hera boss Moldorm, I found myself to die constantly. Due to different game design factors: platform, stage reset and only being able to succeed by hitting its tail where the speed then increases. I became so enraged that I got up, switched the game off and walked away. A week later, I went back in a calm mindset and won on my first try.

  </figure>

<p>
In 2014 a Journal titled ‘psychology of popular media culture’ published by researchers Professor Brad Bushman, Carlos Cruz, and Professor Mario Gollwitzer, revealed that 66% of researchers, 67% of parents and 90% of paediatricians they asked agreed that violent video games can increase a child’s aggressive behaviour. Their research analysed gameplay in Grand Theft Auto IV and how a person immerses themselves in a video game and how their presence within the game increases violent behaviour. They compared people playing violently and shooting bystanders and people playing mini in-games such as bowling. Those who played in a violent manner were found to feel angrier than those who did not.
</p>

<p>
This study emphasises the idea that violent behaviour influenced via video games depends on the style of the game. For example, it is unlikely people will find a game like Super Mario Bros. from the NES influences them to be violent due to its cartoonish art style and characters which resemble actual cartoons that include violence. The Simpsons for example. However, take a game like Grand Theft Auto V on high quality systems like the XBOX ONE or a PC. You play as a character that looks almost real in a human-like environment based off of Los Angeles and put them in believable situations where progressing involves fighting, high-speed driving and guns, then it is possible or potential that the more immersed someone is in the game the more influence violence can have.

<h2>My interview with Sarah</h2>

<p>
  Sarah is a close friend of mine. We have worked on the subject of video games before. Sarah informed me that violence is a factor that plays into her involvement with her and video games. Now she does not perform major violent actions through video games. But I feel what she says is quite interesting with the effect that games have on her. She analyses important facts about the dangers of video games and what they can teach and influence children. She also outlines several issues about the current generation and how video games have made many young people isolated.

    <h1>Can there be one true answer?</h1>

  </header>

</section>

<section class="content">
  <p>
    Violent video games can differentiate their effect on people depending on storylines and motives. Compare a game like Carmageddon and Grand Theft Auto and the storylines behind killing. In Carmageddon there is no storyline and the motives are to kill which adds more factors such as targets, enemies and character development. In Carmageddon there is no character development and the main tactic is to kill in order to progress in the game. Grand Theft Auto does have character development, especially in GTA V where you play as three characters. You also need violence to progress in those games but you have a relationship with what this character is doing and can almost feel guilty when people you have to kill have a face. However, in this game and Carmageddon you kill those with no character development and that dehumanises what is going on because the person feels nothing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This could also be similar to enemies in 80s Nintendo titles like Goomba's, Octorocks and Telly's. In the majority of video games these enemies you kill to progress are synonymously known as grunts because they are simply enemies with no development. The idea of killing to progress tests the strengths of the player and places them in this scenario and to progress they have to show how good they are at playing this. Counterstrike, the ever so popular shooter from Valve has many achievements, weapons, ranks and so forth to be gained but there is no development whatsoever. Characters have faces but it's just computer design and when I play I feel no remorse for my actions, sometimes even proud of a quick kill or winning after being five against one.

  <h2>Game Over: What can be said about video games and violence?</h2>
  <p>
Through academic and my own research, my personal experience and that of others, the idea that video games cause people to be violent is unlikely if not untrue. What can be argued however, is through academic's research and my own, it can be said that video games, not just violently realistic shooters, but many genres and mechanisms of gaming, do cause aggression. Whether it's the intensity of the game, the constant violent aspects, the requirements of playing the game, internet connectivity or involvement with other people, there are signs that this causes aggression. What is problematic is the mainstream media's representation of video games which do not reveal the true extent of the effect they have on people. It falls under a simplistic view as Mark said for an easy answer because even though video games are popular, they are not in the mainstream. What is important is for better understanding of the games, especially from parents who should experience the game themselves before making rational decisions. We can experience different emotions through these video games and same can make us feel awful while others can make us feel nothing and our actions then go unjudged. It shouldn't be looked at that just violent video games are at the heart of the problem because there are multiple issues in modern gaming that shape the way we play and react to them. In the short term there are psychological effects, but in the long-run there is no real evidence to back up any claim.
